# Test and Development Branch - NOT MAIN

## Docker Image Pull Command

To pull the Docker image for the llava-app, use the following command:

"""
docker pull bogdan01m/llava-app:tagname
"""

This command will pull the Docker image with the tag `tagname` from the Docker Hub repository `bogdan01m/llava-app`.

Make sure to replace `tagname` with the actual tag you want to pull, such as `latest` or a specific version tag.

This branch is for testing and development purposes, and is not the main branch. Please do not push changes directly to this branch.
